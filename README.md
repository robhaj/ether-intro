Ether is
- Public Blockchain Platform (database)  
- Programmable Transaction Functionality

Extends bitcoin's blockchain adding "smart contracts" (small programs) to the blockchain.

It operates as a large distrbuted computer, executing programs on nodes all over the world.

## BlockChain?
Think of the blockchain as a distributed database containing a growing list of transaction records  hardened against tampering.

## Smart contracts

Computer protocols that verify or enforce the negotiation or performance of a contract, or that make a contractual clause unnecessary.

Can be implemented in various languages, compiled into bytecode for the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) before being deployed to the blockchain.

The virtual machine's state updates can be written in a Turing complete scripting language.

Described as "a single shared computer that is run by the network of users and on which resources are parceled out and paid for by Ether

## Ether
Secure currency

## Decentralized Apps(DAPP)
Some industries currently implementing DAPP's are finance, IoT, identity management, farm-to-table produce, electricity sourcing/pricing, and sports betting.

Decentralized autonomous organizations may enable a wide range of possible business models that were previously impossible or too costly to run.


## Gas

The platform uses a mechanism called gas to limit contracts that might take a long time to run, charging a certain amount of ether per computation.

Computation on the EVM is "very expensive" because every contract is run on every full Ethereum node, resulting in the consensus of the output.
