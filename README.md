#[Ethereum?](https://www.ethereum.org/)
The Ethereum network
- is a public blockchain platform  
- has a programmable transaction functionality

It extends bitcoin's blockchain adding "smart contracts". These are small programs added to the blockchain.

Ethereum operates as a large distrbuted computer, executing programs on nodes all over the world.

## BlockChain?
Think of the blockchain as a distributed database containing a growing list of transaction records  hardened against tampering.

## Smart contracts
Computer protocols that verify or enforce the negotiation or performance of a contract, or that make a contractual clause unnecessary.

Can be implemented in various languages, compiled into bytecode for the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) before being deployed to the blockchain.

The virtual machine's state updates can be written in a Turing complete scripting language.

Described as "a single shared computer that is run by the network of users and on which resources are parceled out and paid for by Ether

## Ether
THE CRYPTO-FUEL FOR THE ETHEREUM NETWORK

Ether allows developers to create markets, store registries of debts or promises, move funds in accordance with instructions given long in the past, like futures contracts or a will, all without a middle man. It's a form of payment made by the clients of the platform to the machines executing the requested operations. Ether is the incentive ensuring that developers write quality applications (wasteful code costs more), and that the network remains healthy (people are compensated for their contributed resources).

The total supply of ether and its rate of issuance was decided by the donations gathered on the 2014 presale. The results were roughly:

- 60 million ether created to contributors of the presale.

- 12 Million (20% of the above) were created to the development fund, most of it going to early contributors and developers and the remaining to the Ethereum Foundation

- 5 ethers are created every block (about every 15-17 seconds) to the miner of that block

- 2-3 ethers are sometimes sent to another miner if they were also able to find a solution but his block wasn't included (called uncle/aunt reward)

- Issuance of ether is capped at 18 million ether per year (this number equals 25% of the initial supply).

So while the absolute issuance is fixed, the relative inflation is decreased every year. If this issuance was kept indefinitely then at some point the rate of new tokens created every year would reach the average amount lost yearly (by misuse, accidental key lost, death of holders etc) and there would reach an equilibrium. However, sometime in 2017, Ethereum will be switched from Proof of Work to a new consensus algorithm under development, called Casper that is expected to be more efficient and require less mining subsidy.

### Who needs ether?
Developers who intend to build apps that will use the ethereum blockchain. Users who want to access and interact with smart contracts on the ethereum blockchain.


## Decentralized Apps(DAPP)
- Applications that run exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third party interference.
- Some industries currently implementing DAPP's are finance, IoT, identity management, farm-to-table produce, electricity sourcing/pricing, and sports betting.
- On traditional server architectures, every application has to set up its own servers that run their own code in isolated silos, making sharing of data hard. If a single app is compromised or goes offline, many users and other apps are affected. On a blockchain, anyone can set up a node that replicates the necessary data for all nodes to reach an agreement and be compensated by users and app developers. This allows user data to remain private and apps to be decentralized like the Internet was supposed to work.
